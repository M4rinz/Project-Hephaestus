[x] study a bit of theory
[x] more heavy threshold for some features (only for one strange stamina index)
[x] remove cluster_class the second time kmeans is called
[] try different distances in K-Means
[x] try different initial choice strategy
    [x] just try some times random init
    [] hierarchical clustering (small sample, small k wrt sample)
    [] select random -> pick furdest -> iterate (sample) (this is kmeans++ but worst)
    [x] kmeans++
[x] undertand the results (for what my brain can)
[x] work on the races dataset
[x] undertand the results
[x] meglio commenti
[x] heat map
[x] print SSE
[] fix similarity measures (the journey into statistics begin):
    [] cathegorical values (or binary) -> Cramerâ€™s V
    [] numeric/continuos -> Eta-Squared or ANOVA
    [] ordinal 
        -> considering increasing and decreasing cluster: spearman
        -> else, non parametric ANOVA: Kruskal-Wallis H-test
[] Try umap
