[x] study a bit of theory
[x] more heavy threshold for some features (only for one strange stamina index)
[x] remove cluster_class the second time kmeans is called
[] try different distances in K-Means
[x] try different initial choice strategy
    [x] just try some times random init
    [] hierarchical clustering (small sample, small k wrt sample)
    [] select random -> pick furdest -> iterate (sample) (this is kmeans++ but worst)
    [x] kmeans++
[x] undertand the results (for what my brain can)
[] work on the races dataset
[] undertand the results
